# Clothes-description-generator
In this project the description of various fashion clothes images have been generated using the convolution neural networks(For images) and LSTM(For text sequence).  
Convolution neural network has been taken from VGG model.  
LSTM and CNN are then combined to give the final output.  
The tools&technology required are tensorflow, keras and scikit learn.
